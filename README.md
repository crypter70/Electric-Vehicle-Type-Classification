# Electric-Vehicle-Type-Classification
 
## Background
As the market for electric vehicles continues to expand, accurately classifying the types of electric vehicles becomes crucial for various stakeholders, including manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers. Understanding the distribution of BEV and PHEV vehicles in the market can provide valuable insights for infrastructure planning, policy-making, and targeting the right market segments. By developing an accurate classification model, this project aims to contribute to the advancement of electric vehicle research, development, and decision-making.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately identify the type of electric vehicle, distinguishing between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), with the aim of gaining in-depth knowledge and insights into electric vehicle classification.
